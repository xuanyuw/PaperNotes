# LIP-FEF summary <!-- omit in toc -->

## Key Questions

1. How do LIP and FEF connect with each other?
2. Is there other brain areas that could be possible input source?
3. What are the inputs into LIP and FEF?
   1. What is the output of MT?
   2. What is the output of LIP?
4. What are the expected neural activities?
5. Neural oscillation? spike-phase coupling?

## LIP

- LIP integrates noisy sensory inputs & forms oculomotor decision

  - LIP receives anatomical input from MT

- Lewis & van essen 2000a, b
- Maunsell & van essen 1983
- Ungerleider & Desimone 1986
